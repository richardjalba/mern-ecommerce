# mern-ecommerce
This ecommerce web app demonstrates my ability using the MERN stack.

Here is where I will document my efforts in building this ecommerce app.

First I create the Header and Footer components to bring into the App. I'll also be using bootswatch for a free bootstrap theme.

**react-bootstrap**
This allows you to utilize a UI library so you can import bootstrap features directly as React components. Instead of having to use a div with a bootstrap class.

Now I'm able to use bootstrap for formatting and to bring in Navbar, Nav, Container, Button, etc.

**font-awesome**
This gets me access to a variety of icons via classNames.
